      You are planning a software feature. Decompose it into clear user stories.

      Task: {{task}}
      Repo: {{repo}}

      Write 3-7 user stories. Each story must have:
      - Title
      - What the user can do
      - Acceptance criteria (bullet points)
      - Files to create/modify

      Keep stories small and independently implementable.

      End your response with exactly:
      STATUS: done
    expects: "STATUS: done"

  - id: setup
    agent: setup
    model: blockrun/eco

    input: |
      You are setting up a project structure based on a plan.

      Repo: {{repo}}
      Plan:
      {{plan}}

      Create the required directories and base files.
      Use: mkdir -p, touch, and basic file scaffolding.
      Do not implement logic yet — just structure.

      Run commands in the repo directory.
      End with exactly:
      STATUS: done
    expects: "STATUS: done"

  - id: implement
    agent: developer

    timeout: 900
    input: |
      You are implementing a software feature.

      Repo: {{repo}}
      Plan:
      {{plan}}

      Implement every story from the plan. Write clean, working code.
      - One story at a time
      - Write the actual code files
      - Handle edge cases
      - Add inline comments for complex logic

      End with exactly:
      STATUS: done
    expects: "STATUS: done"

  - id: verify
    agent: verifier
    model: blockrun/eco

    input: |
      You are verifying a software implementation against acceptance criteria.

      Repo: {{repo}}
      Plan:
      {{plan}}

      Implementation summary:
      {{implement}}

      Check each story's acceptance criteria. Read the actual files.
      List what passes and what fails.

      End with either:
      STATUS: done (all criteria met)
      STATUS: failed (list what failed)
    expects: "STATUS:"

  - id: test
    agent: tester
    model: blockrun/eco
    timeout: 600
    input: |
      You are writing and running tests for a software implementation.

      Repo: {{repo}}
      Implementation:
      {{implement}}

      Write tests for the key functions. Run them.
      Fix any failures you find.

      End with exactly:
      STATUS: done
    expects: "STATUS: done"

  - id: pr
    agent: developer
    model: blockrun/eco
    timeout: 120
    input: |
      Create a GitHub Pull Request for the completed feature.

      Repo: {{repo}}
      Task: {{task}}
      Run ID: {{run_id}}

      Steps:
      1. git add -A
      2. git commit -m "feat: {{task_short}}"
      3. git push origin HEAD
      4. gh pr create --title "feat: {{task_short}}" --body "ClawFarm run {{run_id}}"

      End with the PR URL and:
      STATUS: done
    expects: "STATUS: done"

  - id: review
    agent: reviewer
    model: blockrun/sonnet
    timeout: 300
    input: |
      You are doing a code review.

      Repo: {{repo}}
      Task: {{task}}

      Review the implementation for:
      - Correctness (does it do what was asked?)
      - Security issues
      - Code quality and readability
      - Missing error handling

      End with either:
      APPROVED
      REQUEST_CHANGES: (list changes needed)
    expects: "APPROVED|REQUEST_CHANGES"
